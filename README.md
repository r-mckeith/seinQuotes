Users of seinQuotes want to see hilarious Seinfeld quotes because they know that Seinfeld is the best, and they want to beat the high score so they can brag to their friends that they're the #1 fan.

<!-- Challenges -->
I have yet to implement a real leaderboard. For the time being The high score is set to an unattainable fifty. If you reach 51 congratulations, you have broken my code. 

The HTML and CSS for the toggle were borrowed from w3schools. The rest of the code is mine. Thanks you for reading, and have a good time.
