Users of seinQuotes want to see hilarious Seinfeld quotes because they know that Seinfeld is the best, and they want to beat the high score so all their friends will know they are the #1 fan. Users of seinQuotes would also like to meet Julia Louise Dreyfus one day because they think they would hit it off and become really good friends.

<!-- Challenges -->
I have yet to implement a real leaderboard. For the time being The high score is set to a (hopefully) unattainable fifty. I also still need to make it responsive.
